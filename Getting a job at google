<h1><b>How To Get A Job At Google!</b></h1>
<p> I created this webpage using a fantastic front end development software called <i><b>Atom</b></i>. This personal project of mine started when I was learning statistical programming with <i><b>R</b></i>, and I decided that working on two projects simultaneoulsy would be a fun challenge.</p>


<h2><b>Location! Location! Location!</b></h2>
<ul>The graph below illustrates the analysis of 1250 observations of Google's job opportunities data. The selected 12 locations on this graph yielded more than 25 job opening each! In total, there were 92 seperate locations with job postings! It is clear that the vast majority of current job opportunities are locate in Mountain View, California with just over 15% of available positions
  California in total yielded 449 of the total 1250 available position, that's over 35% of the positions!. </ul>

<h3><b>Who am I?</b></h3>
<div><h4><b>Education</b></h4>
  <p><ul>
 <b>Loyola University Maryland (Baltimore, Maryland)</b>
 <ul><li>Masters of Science, Psychology with a focus on Statistics and Organizational Development
 3.95 GPA, Graduated August, 2017
 Member of Psi Chi, International Honor Society on Psychology (September 2014-Present)
 Member of the American Counseling Association (March 2016-Present)</li></ul>

 <ul><li><b>Worcester State University (Worcester, Massachusetts)</b></li>
 Bachelors of Science, Psychology with a focus on Statistics and Organizational Development

</ul>
<div><b>Work/Internship Experience</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Johns Hopkins Medicine (Dec 2017 – Present), Performance Improvement Analyst</b></li>
<ul> <li>Maintain, update, and create daily, weekly, monthly, and historical reports of call center metrics and
hospital key performance indicators (KPIs). These reports were focused on call center agent metrics
including, but not limited to: average speed of answer, total staffed time, full time employee hours, and the
number of outbound calls.</li>
<li>A number of these reports are generated automatically through Visual Basic for Application macros, and
my role involved updating and troubleshooting report errors on a daily basis.
-Tableau is used to pull operation metrics from both Avaya phone systems, and EPIC software. In doing
this, we are able to analyze 22 departments of medicine in a single centralized location. The key
performance indicators that we examined included but are not limited to: utilization rates, cancellation
rates, percentage of international appointments, and hours logged. Survey information is also gathered to
measure overall patient satisfaction rates in regards to access to care, median lag days, and visit
satisfaction.</li>
<li>I have been working on a number of individual projects, one being a space management overhaul.
The goal of this project was to create a template of our office area and determine what space is/is not
accounted for. This space contains agents for 22 departments of medicine, several managers, and multiple
Directors. With the completion of this project, we are more capable of determining what resources
we have, what can be changed, and what resources are not necessary for our overall success.
Another ongoing project of mine is working to create SharePoint sites for every department. These sites
would allow agents, managers, administrators, and schedulers within each department to better organize
and store necessary information to carry out daily tasks with great efficiency. This project does not only
include creating the sites, but maintaining it, creating Standard Operating Procedures, and training
agents/supervisors/managers on site usage.</li>

scheduled with the appropriate clinician based on their individual needs</li>
<li>Ran Intensive Outpatient Treatment Groups, and provided psychoeducation to a diverse client population</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts (Sept 2014 – Dec 2014), Research Assistant</b></li>
